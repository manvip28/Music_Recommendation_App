# AI Music Recommendation App

## Overview

The AI Music Recommendation App is a Streamlit-based web application that suggests new songs to users based on their favorite Spotify playlists. By analyzing the audio features of the tracks in a given playlist, the app recommends songs with similar characteristics, helping users discover new music tailored to their tastes.

## Features

- **Playlist Analysis**: Input a Spotify playlist URL to analyze its tracks.
- **Song Recommendations**: Receive song suggestions based on the analyzed playlist.
- **Direct Links**: Access Spotify search results for recommended songs directly from the app.

## Dataset

The app utilizes the "Spotify 1.2M+ Songs" dataset, which contains audio features for over 1.2 million songs obtained through the Spotify API. This dataset is essential for the recommendation system to function effectively.

**Download the dataset**:

1. Visit the dataset page on Kaggle: [Spotify 1.2M+ Songs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs/data)
2. Log in to your Kaggle account.
3. Click on the "Download" button to obtain the dataset files.

## Spotify API Integration

The app uses the Spotify Web API to fetch playlist data and retrieve song details. To authenticate API requests, you'll need to set up your Spotify Developer account and generate the required credentials.

### Steps to Get Spotify API Credentials:

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login).
2. Log in or create an account.
3. Click on **Create an App** and fill in the necessary details.
4. After creating the app, you will be provided with a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
5. Set up a redirect URI (e.g., `http://localhost:8888/callback`) for authentication.

### Configure API Credentials

#### âœ… Using Notepad

You can also create and edit the file directly using Notepad:

1. Run the following command in PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```powershell
notepad .streamlit\secrets.toml
```

2. When Notepad opens, paste your Spotify credentials like this:

```toml
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id_here"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = "your_client_secret_here"
```

3. Save and close the file.

   ```

4. **Download and prepare the dataset**:
